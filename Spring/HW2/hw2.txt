For assignment 2, due midnight on Sunday 2/22, draw on the code from Lecture 1, Assignment 1 and Lecture 2, to create a more complete version version of Crap Chat. The new version should allow the user to 
 
1. take a picture (requires device)
2. add text and move that around
3. draw on the picture
4. stamp the location of the device onto the picture
5. stamp the orientation of the device (numerical x,y,z values from accelerometer) onto the picture
6. save the picture to PhotoRoll and/or email it (requires device)
 
You'll need to google and use Stack Overflow to figure out how to email the photo. Hint: you can use MFMailComposerViewController, and post on Piazza for help from your peers.
 
Feel free to refer or even start from our TA's code from Assignment 1 from last year, available here: PhotoEditor.zip (Code courtesy of Tom Peng.)
